It is the year 30XX.

After centuries of galactic peace, mankind's ultimate enemy has reemerged:

Dragons.

These all-consuming killing machines have destroyed nearly every sector of the plotted universe, and humanity has been pushed to the last remnant of secure space: the AVD-1230 nebula.

Our top scientists have reverse-engineered salvaged dragon technology to devise the ultimate weapon: the dragon launcher. 

This is our last stand.
This is... The Dragoning.
